As a continuation to this, I have done a project on ‘The Smart\nControlling of Microwave oven’. Microwave oven has become an indispensable\nappliance in the 21st century.The\nincreasing urbanisation in developing countries and\naccessibility to power has also led to an increase in the usage of microwave ovens at the household level\nworldwide.Today, microwave\novens are\nmainly used for cooking as well as for reheating of food. Compact design and easy portability of a microwave\noven is a factor anticipated to increase the demand and drives the growth of\nthe global microwave oven market. The proposed microwave oven has OVEN\nTOAST GRILLER and CONVECTION mode operation. This can be used for pre-heating\nthe food at a lower cost and it can be controlled with a mobile app. It can be\noperated from any place using WiFi or Bluetooth. Moreover\nthe oven can be programmed to operate at a certain temperature and for a\ncertain time according to the product to be heated, with a single tap on the\npicture of the product via the app. This increases the ease for heating a\ncertain food item because most of the people are ignorant of the right heat and\ntime required to heat a certain food item, such as a cake. This can also lead\nto increase in the use of ovens and will ultimately lead to a smarter country.\nNot only this, the oven will be also able to defrost an item and heat it with\njust a tap on the phone in the required time. </p>\n\n<p>In the prototype\nmodel, testing is done with a preheating temperature  upto a range of 30 degree. Using this smart oven\nis a hassle free process and time saving. After the food is cooked we receive\nalert and it will be turned off automatically.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Future scope:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>This microwave oven is used for\npre-heating and cooking the food with low cost. It can be further enhanced to be\nused as a smart oven to Scan\nbarcode on packaged food and automatically download the proper cooking\ninstructions to follow to prepare the food. Even a voice control systems\nsuch as Alexa or Google Assistant can be installed. It can track the\nmost commonly cooked foods to suggest customized quick settings and provide\nphotos of each step, and in some cases, even play short videos of recipe steps.\nMoisture\nsensors monitor food throughout the cooking process to prevent food from drying\nout and overcooking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This project emphasis the\npreheating and cooking of food using a smart microwave oven controlled by smartphone that is constructed at very low cost.</p>\n\n<p> </p>","created-at":"2019-12-20T13:28:16.708617+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2019-12-20T13:28:15.488000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":true,"title":"Smart Electronic Management System ","level":"Intermediate","video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-01-19T09:00:07.807584+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"<a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/vqT8bLtBqRRtM5YQ9\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://photos.app.goo.gl/vqT8bLtBqRRtM5YQ9</a>","id":"5859"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"Building an Open Source Hardware manufacturing world is about the advances that <a href=\"http://MakerNet.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MakerNet.org</a> and Open Know How are making in enabling large scale distributed manufacturing, as well as inviting people to join us in developing open products and open standards to make it grow.","created-at":"2020-02-18T06:56:54.006713+00:00","state":"confirmed","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":"2020-03-21T11:40:00+00:00","subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-02-18T06:56:53.062000+00:00","starts-at":"2020-03-21T11:10:00+00:00","language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Building an Open Source Hardware Manufacturing World","level":"","video-url":null,"slides-url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17hE-iHNB7btjw5jQqIf7-tuxPgTPzNAhhm1K4vng51Q/edit?usp=sharing","last-modified-at":"2020-03-17T19:28:00.703673+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"Slides are still work in progress.Note that they include some humor, this is by design to keep it entertaining, but we are absolutely professional about what we're doing, and the presentation will tackle tough subjects.","id":"6145"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"Adding WebSocket support for a Django-based IoT serverDjango is known as a synchronous web framework, but with a strong ecosystem, it can adapt well to new demand for asynchronous communications, like WebSocket.

It gives developers an easy way to build and deploy visually attractive, fast mobile apps on both Android and iOS platforms. Flutter enables a smooth and easy cross-platform mobile app development. In order to use an app made suing Flutter, a user still needs to interact with the device and the most common type of interaction is gestures.  Gestures are primarily a way for a user to interact with a mobile (or any touch-based device) application. Flutter provides excellent support for all types of gestures through its exclusive widget, GestureDetector. GestureDetector is a non-visual widget primarily used for detecting the user’s gesture. This talk will focus on the callbacks provided by the extremely versatile GestureDetector widget and how the GestureDetector actually works. We will go deep into the internal working of the widget to understand what actually happens in the backend and see all the components involved. </p>","created-at":"2020-01-19T07:40:28.716993+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-19T07:40:24.796000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"A Deep Dive into Flutter Gestures","level":"3/5","video-url":null,"slides-url":"https://slides.com/yashkhare/deck","last-modified-at":"2020-02-29T09:51:03.650585+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"Flutter provides a lot mind-blowing widgets out of the box which are pre-built to handle touch events such as in InkWell and InkResponse.

Corporations were reluctant to use open source, largely out of fears related to intellectual property and licensing. The dominant vendors of proprietary software were very successful in raising fears about open source software. As a result, open source solutions were rarely included in product evaluations or adopted for use in business-critical situations.Today, open source software is ubiquitous. More than a third of the world's servers run on Linux, RedHat's annual revenue exceeds $1B, and the vast majority of companies report that they are using open source software in their organization.  Even the largest proprietary software companies offer some open source software, and support various foundations involved in the creation of open source software.  Furthermore, large open source projects such as OpenStack and Hadoop are finding not only commercial adoption of their software, but also the creation of multiple vendors who offer professional services related to the use of the software.  This level of adoption was barely conceivable a decade ago, even to those people who have long been involved in the open source community.While open source software now seems firmly entrenched in the mainstream, the future of open source remains unclear in some areas. Apple's products, while using significant amounts of open source software, are completely proprietary, as are the vast majority of apps written for mobile platforms and other devices. The software embedded in automobiles, wearables, and medical devices is almost entirely proprietary, as is almost all software hosted in the cloud.  As a result, the future of open source software is not at all certain, and it will take a continuing effort to make companies, governments, and non-profit organizations aware of the value provided by open source software.This talk reviews the history of open source software, going back more than 30 years, but focusing on the present and on likely future trends.

For the security-conscious, encryption technology built into the processor and on additional PCIe cryptography cards is accessible in Linux, allowing for end-to-end encryption of data at rest and in flight that doesn’t burn all of your regular processing resources. Enterprise-grade hardware that also has built-in redundancy reduces the need for management you would have for a fleet of x86 servers, and modern mainframes even fit into a 19” rack space in the datacenter.

Instead of a purely numeric calculated score OSSpal adds curation of high-quality FOSS projects and individual user reviews of these criteria, OSSpal has an operational, publicly available website where users may search by project name or category, and enter ratings and reviews for projects.","created-at":"2019-12-18T16:36:54.496060+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2019-12-18T16:36:54.343000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"OSSpal: Finding and Evaluating Open Source Software","level":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-01-18T21:32:13.673762+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"5783"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"Lightning Talks","created-at":"2020-03-04T13:32:33.696427+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-03-04T13:32:33.575000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Lightning Talks","level":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-03-15T18:49:19.225647+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"6182"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"Welcome to the FOSSASIA Summit 2020!","created-at":"2020-03-05T10:57:00.458820+00:00","state":"confirmed","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":"2020-03-19T10:10:00+00:00","subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-03-05T10:57:00.259000+00:00","starts-at":"2020-03-19T10:00:00+00:00","language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"FOSSASIA Summit 2020 - Towards a Sustainable Society","level":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-03-14T17:12:33.133447+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"6193"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"How can Open Source help to build a sustainable world? How can SMEs and organisations leverage on SkillsFuture initiatives and Open Source to build sustainable solutions?","created-at":"2020-03-05T10:51:20.101101+00:00","state":"confirmed","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":"2020-03-19T12:00:00+00:00","subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-03-05T10:51:19.975000+00:00","starts-at":"2020-03-19T11:20:00+00:00","language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Panel: Creating a Sustainable World through Open Source and Lifelong Learning","level":null,"video-url":"https://youtu.be/X9k8wT_3X0I","slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-04-08T14:07:36.510837+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"6192"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"The healthcare domain has incredibly complex logistical needs around the clock to keep hospitals and various medical facilities running smoothly.

Geospatial data is taking off, as companies realize that just about everyone needs the benefits of geospatially aware applications. As a result there are no shortages of unique but demanding use cases of how enterprises are leveraging large-scale and fast geospatial big data processing. The data must be processed in large quantities - and quickly - to reveal hidden spatiotemporal insights vital to businesses and their end users.  In the rush to tap into geospatial data, many enterprises will find that representing, indexing and querying geospatially-enriched data is more complex than they anticipated - and might bring about tradeoffs between accuracy, latency, and throughput.</p><p>This presentation will explore how we added location data to a scalable real-time anomaly detection application, built around Apache Kafka, and Cassandra. Kafka and Cassandra are designed for time-series data, however, it’s not so obvious how they can process geospatial data. In order to find location-specific anomalies, we need a way to represent locations, index locations, and query locations. We explore alternative geospatial representations including: Latitude/Longitude points, Bounding Boxes, Geohashes, and go vertical with 3D representations, including 3D Geohashes. For each representation we also explore possible Cassandra implementations including: Clustering columns, Secondary indexes, Denormalized tables, and the Cassandra Lucene Index Plugin.  To conclude we measure and compare the query throughput of some of the solutions, and summarise the results in terms of accuracy vs. performance to answer the question “Which geospatial data representation and Cassandra implementation is best?”</p>","created-at":"2019-12-17T04:59:30.941845+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2019-12-17T04:59:28.984000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Massively Scalable Real-time Geospatial Data Processing with Apache Kafka and Cassandra","level":"intermediate","video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-02-29T08:43:28.060137+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"Hi, this talk will focus on the geospatial extensions of an Anomaly Detection Application (see other proposed talk). It will be based on a 4 part blog series (this is part 4): <a href=\"https://www.instaclustr.com/geospatial-anomaly-detection-part-4-cassandra-lucene-index-plugin/The\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instaclustr.com/geospatial-anomaly-detection-part-4-cassandra-lucene-index-plugin/The</a> focus is on better understanding the implementation alternatives and tradeoffs of using Apache Cassandra for geospatial data.I could do a short (20m) or long (45m) version.","id":"5760"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"In recent versions, mysql has great feature in upgrade where users need not to run mysql_upgrade explicitly but taken care by server itself during startup with older server data dir.

Machine teaching is a new concept which focuses on optimizing the training data to achieve the results in a few days. The optimization of training data can be achieved by using human experience and integrating this human experience into the machine learning model. The machine teaching discipline has applications in security, education and AI System building. We applied machine teaching concepts to web application security and achieved improved performance.

UNESCO has long played a leading role in international standard-setting and cooperation, and our Member States have now recognized the need for us to develop ethical principles for AI. In this way,we can help to ensure that technological development is aligned with a human- centered vision, with human rights being respected and sustainable development being advanced. This is why UNESCO engages in analysis and reflection on AI, including from the basis of our mandate to promote freedom of expression and build inclusive knowledge societies. Recognizing that there are no simple answers about what the future holds for humanity , this research report is a contribution to the wider debate about the ethics and governance of AI. It is an attempt to 'steer' clear of both technological utopianism, and dystopian thinking. Instead of technological determinism and its implication of inevitability, UNESCO gives attention to the role of human agency and human-centered values ​​in the development of AI and other advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs). Our starting point is with recognizing AI as an opportunity to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to construct knowledge societies. For UNESCO, these kinds of societies are based upon free expression, access to information , quality education and respect for cultural and linguistic diversity. They represent a vision to which we can aspire, and a beacon as we walk the path in shaping AI's role for humanity. This mission applies to UNESCO's work around not only AI, but also to developments such as the Internet of Things, blockchain, biometrics and algorithmic decision-making . While we examine opportunities, we also seek to identify and mitigate risks such as those posed by arbitrary and bulk surveillance, profiling and violations of privacy and equality. This is important in assessing the potential impacts of continued digitalization on education, the sciences, culture, and communication and information, as well as on employment, equality and empowerment.","created-at":"2020-01-10T15:45:48.268809+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-10T15:45:47.071000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Steering AI for Knowledge Societies: a Rights, Openness, Access, and Multi-stakeholder Perspective","level":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-03-22T05:30:00.355639+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"5969"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":"2020-01-14T16:57:41.193866+00:00","average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"<p>Carto - the leading location intelligence platform for data scientists - has chosen Google BigQuery as a key piece for their data intelligence backbone.

Developments in the field already-have a direct impact is our work in the areas of education, natural and human sciences, culture, as well as communication and information. UNESCO has long played a leading role in international standard-setting and cooperation, and our Member States have now recognized the need for us to develop ethical principles for AI. In this way,we can help to ensure that technological development is aligned with a human- centered vision, with human rights being respected and sustainable development being advanced. This is why UNESCO engages in analysis and reflection on AI, including from the basis of our mandate to promote freedom of expression and build inclusive knowledge societies. Recognizing that there are no simple answers about what the future holds for humanity , this research report is a contribution to the wider debate about the ethics and governance of AI. It is an attempt to 'steer' clear of both technological utopianism, and dystopian thinking. Instead of technological determinism and its implication of inevitability, UNESCO gives attention to the role of human agency and human-centered values ​​in the development of AI and other advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs). Our starting point is with recognizing AI as an opportunity to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to construct knowledge societies. For UNESCO, these kinds of societies are based upon free expression, access to information , quality education and respect for cultural and linguistic diversity. They represent a vision to which we can aspire, and a beacon as we walk the path in shaping AI's role for humanity. This mission applies to UNESCO's work around not only AI, but also to developmentssuch as the Internet of Things, blockchain, biometrics and algorithmic decision-making . While we examine opportunities, we also seek to identify and mitigate risks such as those posed by arbitrary and bulk surveillance, profiling and violations of privacy and equality. This is important in assessing the potential impacts of continued digitalization on education, the sciences, culture, and communication and information, as well as on employment, equality and empowerment.","created-at":"2020-01-10T15:41:50.170914+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-10T15:41:49.306000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Steering AI for Knowledge Societies: a Rights, Openness, Access, and Multi-stakeholder Perspective","level":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-03-22T05:30:00.544326+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"5968"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"Few shot learning aims at leveraging huge database for training deep neural nets models to be used onto problems with very few data.

At the very early stage, web development comprised of a small number of technologies and uncomplicated processes. JavaScript became the dominant language in front-end application development. Along the timeline, several solutions emerged to abstract the complexity of application logic. These abstractions led to different generations in JavaScript application development. Each library and framework developed provided different levels of abstractions based on different sets of fundamental ideas. jQuery provided convenient APIs to manipulate DOM. Structured single-page applications were created with Backbone.js Ember.js, and Angular.js. To address the performance issues, React came up with virtual DOM. As a result of solving different important issues, eventually many generations of JavaScript applications were born. Svelte presents the next step in JavaScript application development. Svelte is an open-source UI compiler that takes all the heavy lifting from runtime to build stage. Svelte encapsulates the idea of generating a highly optimized codebase at the build stage and takes a step away from the virtual DOM mechanism.

I only wanted to convey the sentiment - 'Let's make web-accessible again’.  However, this is exactly how the text will appear to a dyslexic person reading this. It is but one of the many issues differently-abled people face every day on the web. And web in its very nature is supposed to be a place accessible to all. It is for everyone no matter what their hardware, software, language, location, internet quality or ability. Even the first website ever developed in 1991 was fully accessible. So why are we engineers making it inaccessible?</p><p>If you think it doesn’t really matter because the target audience is small, think again! Talking about numbers, currently, 15% of the world population have some form of disability. An inaccessible website is not only very unempathetic but also a barrier to potential consumers. Mike BrolyLegs Begum, the renowned esports Street Fighter player, is a perfect example of one of the stories about people overcoming a degenerative condition with the help of assistive technologies.</p><p>Moreover, websites need to maintain a specified level of accessibility to be legal. It’s not uncommon for giants to pay hefty fines for lawsuits filed against their websites being inaccessible.

It’s only when biggies like Domino’s are targeted,  people take things more seriously.</p><p>A lot of people tend to ignore accessibility when designing a website because it’s hard to notice. Also, it is not a part of the curriculum. Furthermore, there’s a lot of misconception about how making a website accessible hampers it’s design. It’s actually the opposite.

The developers need to support the product for its entire lifetime. The quality of product support is critical to the success of the product. Good product support makes users happy who will in turn become the best advocates of your product and bring more users. Bad product support will damage your company's image and waste marketing efforts that bring in users who are later disappointed by how the product is supported. For enterprise softwares, product support may even have legal implications with the requirements of SLAs. Traditionally companies that offer enterprise softwares hire a large group of enterprise sales people to install/configure and answer customer queries. This is not always scalable, especially when you are a small company or when your product has way too many users. WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging platforms, and is supporting billions of its users to keep in touch with their most closed ones by offering a simple interface and a secure end-to-end encrypted messaging channel. Since the close beta launch of the WhatsApp Business API 2018, we have seen great interests from innumerable businesses. Even with a relatively small list of closed beta partners, the topic of how to properly scale product support is always at the heart of the team. Unlike traditional enterprise softwares, We turn the other way, to the open source world, on how to scale product support. The open source software world is never short of popular product. Millions of developers are running their production system on Linux systems and building storefronts with React every day. Developers trust the system because they can see every line of code that builds up the product, they can fork their own clone to make customised changes and submit pull requests so the product can be improved. Developers can search through Github issues when they are stuck and the community powers itself. From a product perspective, this is a wonderful way to scale product support: by giving users tools that they can trust and offering users a platform where they can openly discuss issues and collaborate on solutions.

Kube Edge and K3S are two projects supported by CNCF and gives the ability for \n\nkubernetes framework to sit at the edge.","created-at":"2019-12-17T02:42:19.409726+00:00","state":"confirmed","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":"2020-03-20T17:30:00+00:00","subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2019-12-17T02:41:46.918000+00:00","starts-at":"2020-03-20T17:00:00+00:00","language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Kubernetes at the Edge [Online]","level":"400","video-url":"https://youtu.be/DPUBJntzYFA","slides-url":"https://api.eventyay.com/static/media/events/temp/6d2ae061-728c-4186-bc97-88852f528697/ektyNnlDZU/d3a9d1e8-8945-40e9-90d1-245e428a82ec.pdf","last-modified-at":"2020-04-10T09:57:01.589758+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"Please schedule my session on a weekend day please.

In Addition, there is a specific focus on fundraising, as the project is not backed by a company but is completely independent. The historical overview will be based on software releases, adding facts and figures about the project.

So we do understand how important communities are. The question is, do we understand what is the essence of a community, or how to engage one and make sure it's moving forward?When we talk about measuring the success and health of a community, people like to throw around metrics without truly understanding if these numbers actually mean something for our community's growth. These 'vanity metrics' create an idea of pseudo-value and don't really say much about the state of our community. Just because it is something we can measure, it does not mean it is helpful. Do DevRel folks report back vanity metrics to their managers? Yes. Does this information say a lot about the direction the community is moving in? No. Do we need more sensible metrics? Absolutely.With my talk, 'The Anatomy of Communities', I aim to open up a new dimension to understanding the elements that make up a community and talk about applicable key metrics that actually make sense and can be employed to track the health of a community. The talk will take the audience through a human centric approach towards building positive, compassionate, and diverse spaces for developers and ensuring that these spaces don't experience stagnation.","created-at":"2020-01-21T19:05:05.458529+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-21T19:05:04.122000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"The Anatomy of Communities ","level":"Suitable for all audience ","video-url":null,"slides-url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b4qDl-f0Qzn_WRXTUXsmV4Lv78CMBcSeb9uJCneWI-w/edit?usp=sharing","last-modified-at":"2020-02-29T06:37:52.258510+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"Here is a rather short and rough version of this abstract that I did as an impromptu talk at React India 2019 community lounge.Video: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/10IipOe25xzzV0Gcj2qUyAzUbCLxN3OD5/view\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/10IipOe25xzzV0Gcj2qUyAzUbCLxN3OD5/view</a>","id":"6059"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"Be The Leader You Need<p>Open source crossed the chasm into mainstream with users in all industries.

Carpenter of IAB and Fred Baker of IETF wrote a \nco-statement on cryptographic technology and the internet.  This RFC \nwasn't a request for a technical standard, it was a statement on their \nconcerns about Governments trying to restrict or interfere with \ncryptography. They felt that there was a need to offer \"All Internet \nUsers an adequate degree of privacy\"\n\nSince that time successive governments around the world have sought to \nbuild back doors into encrypted apps and services to access more citizen\n and visitor data. As of July 2019, the AG of the United States William\n Barr stated: “Some argue that, to achieve at best a slight incremental \nimprovement in security, it is worth imposing a massive cost on society \nin the form of degraded safety,” i.e For security Americans should \naccept weakened encryption.  The head of the FBI also claimed that \nweakened encryption wouldn't break it.  \n\nIn Australia the metadata retention laws have been abused against \njournalists with 58 searches carried out by the AFP.  In 2015 ACT police\n carried out 115 metadata searches.  UK officials have a cavalier \nattitude to the EU SIS database which tracks undocumented migrants, \nmissing people, stolen cars, or suspected criminals. IETF Session 105 mentioned privacy and concerns with the mass collection\n of data. While the IAB and IESG were worried about US export controls \non cryptography there is an argument for RFC 1984 to be updated to \ninclude the unnecessary mass collection of data and to use it as a term \nfor IT professionals, privacy advocates and the public to rally behind. In this talk let's recount a brief history of governments around the \nworld wanting to weaken encryption as RFC 1984 warned us about.  \n\nWe live in a time where citizens put data into commercial, healthcare \nand Government systems to access services, some services are only \naccessible online. From CCTV to Facebook people have little \nunderstanding of why mass collection of data is dangerous. There is \nlittle scrutiny of who can access that data, from Scotland to the US. Open Surveillance is only a small part of the picture when profiling \ncitizens.  It still counts as personal data, when combined with metadata\n and the actual data that people put into social media and services like\n ancestor DNA test kits.  Businesses who use CCTV have to put up signs \nto warn the public they are recording.  So called anonymized data still \ncontains identifiers that can tie to individuals. \nLet's talk about Ovid and peacocks. Let's explore how to expand the RFC \nto cover recent developments in surveillance capitalism with governments\n accessing that data, but not securing it. We need to make it clear \nweakened encryption, the mass collection and careless retention of data \nisn't acceptable. We need to update and implement RFC 1984.","created-at":"2020-01-25T10:12:39.902607+00:00","state":"confirmed","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":"2020-03-21T16:20:00+00:00","subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-25T10:12:39.371000+00:00","starts-at":"2020-03-21T15:30:00+00:00","language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"RFC 1984: Or why you should start worrying about encryption backdoors and mass data collection  [Online]","level":"Understandable by everyone.","video-url":"https://youtu.be/2AgPQFLFMZU","slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-04-08T13:59:31.677637+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"Why we need to implement RFC 1984:\n\n\"The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering\n   Steering Group (IESG),[...] are concerned by the need for increased\n   protection of international commercial transactions on the Internet,\n   and by the need to offer all Internet users an adequate degree of\n   privacy.\n\" \nI'd like to start by briefly mentioning Ovid and the legend of Io.  Ovid\n was anti authoritarian during the time of Augustus as he'd been exiled \nby the Emperor.  He wrote The Metamorphoses; an epic poem about Greek \nmyths with the theme of transformation. The myth is often used as a \nmetaphor for surveillance.  With Io suffering restriction of liberty and\n being abused by authority. Being turned into a cow was bad enough, to \nmake things worse she was constantly watched by the agent of Hera \nanother authority Argus (Argus Panoptes) the 100 eyed giant.  Argus is a\n great name for a security firm in fact there are quite a few firms that\n use an eye in the logo. Pop culture like Neil Gamien's American gods on Amazon  have also \nreferenced this legend to show surveillance and how it can convey power \nto authority. In the end a modern interpretation of the myth could \nargue that Hermes sending Argus to sleep to kill him is a good metaphor \nfor opposing actors using exploits to subvert and disable surveillance \nto access information to Citizens data.   We focus more on Argus the \nagent of Surveillance rather than Io, who was violated, changed and then\n incarcerated with surveillance against her will. Argus Panoptes inspired the idea of the Panopticon. A  building design \nby English Philospher Jeremy Bentham as a prison that could be observed \nby a single guard.  Our Internet is in danger of being a virtual \npanopticon for future citizens.  The EFF already started thinking about \nthis with panopticlick so that you can test who's tracking you through \nyour browser. So who's watching us? Of course this explanation and the metaphor is from a Western \nPerspective.  Privacy doesn't mean the same thing to all countries and \ncultures.  Neither does the symbolism of the Peacock. There will be a brief explanation of  RFCs for those who don't know what\n they are. They are Requests for Comment and some of them become \nprotocols for services like Emails RFC 2822 - Internet Message Format, \nRFC 5321 - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.  RFC Protocols are a very good\n way of creating technical standards so that everyone on the internet \ncan communicate and access data. \n\nMany IT professionals consider RFCs are more like guidelines, see RFC \n<a href=\"http://Clueless.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Clueless.org</a>. Popular email services like <a href=\"http://Me.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Me.com</a>, <a href=\"http://Outlook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Outlook.com</a> and even \n<a href=\"http://gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">gmail.com</a> have been listed on RFC ignorant, then it's successor RFC \nclueless .  Sadly the giants often ignore RFCs.   Which breaks the idea \nof interoperable standards and protocols and leaves us in danger of \nbeing at the  mercy of large hosting giants. There is a narrative that threads through the media since that time.  \nPrivacy is dead, you need to give up that freedom to stay safe.  \nPoliticians like the UK Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015 stated:\n\n.\"In our country, do we want to allow a means of communication between \npeople which even in extremis, with a signed warrant from the home \nsecretary personally, that we cannot read? “Up until now, governments \nhave said: ‘No, we must not'.\" \"\n\nMalcolm Turnbull the Australian Prime Minister in 2017 stated that \" the\n laws of Australia take precedence over the laws of mathematics.\"  \n\nWith organizations like Palantir providing information to ICE to target \nillegal immigrants in the US; The UK Home Office deliberately destroying\n data in the the Windrush scandal;  It's clear that human rights, \nspecifically the right to privacy is in danger. \n\nThat's before I even start on repressive regimes where that data can and\n will be used to oppress citizens of that regime.  Australia is not \nimmune from this desire for governments to spy and profile their own \ncitizens and to provide a hostile environment to immigrants and it's own\n citizens who may criticize that government. \nThe recent IETF Session 105 this month mentioned privacy and concerns \nwith the mass collection of data. While the IAB and IESG were worried \nabout US export controls on cryptography there is an argument for \nRFC1984 to be updated to include the unnecessary mass collection of data\n and to use it as a term for IT professionals, privacy advocates and the\n public to rally behind. I propose a brief history of governments around the world wanting to \nweaken encryption as RFC1984 warned us about:\n\n \" The IAB and IESG are therefore disturbed to note that various\n   governments have actual or proposed policies on access to\n   cryptographic technology that either: \n   (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or\n\n   (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate\n       mechanisms such as short cryptographic keys; and/or \n   (c) mandate that private decryption keys should be in the hands of\n       the government or of some other third party; and/or \n   (d) prohibit the use of cryptology entirely, or permit it only to\n       specially authorized organizations.\" RFC 1984 was explicitly named to reference an Orwellian Society that \nuses mass surveillance.  Let's expand that beyond encryption to the mass\n collection of data and ask how do we limit this?  How do we limit \naccess to this data?  How do we stop the nightmare?\n\nAddendum: As time goes on with the current political climate, I expect \nmore focus by the media and the IAB and the IETF on this subject.  So \nwhile the overall thrust of this presentation will be the same, I plan \nto keep it as fresh as possible.

There are many curve standards used in Elliptic Curve Cryptography such as ANSI X9.62 (1999), IEEE P1363 (2000), SEC 2 (2000), NIST FIPS 186-2 (2000), ANSI X9.63 (2001), Brainpool (2005), NSA Suite B (2005), and ANSSI FRP256V1 (2011). All the standards try to address the elliptic-curve discrete-logarithm problem(ECDLP) but they fail in one or more aspects such as rigidity, transfer, rho or field discriminants. The implementation of the above standard produces incorrect results and leaks data with respect to some curves. The problem even worsens when non-standard curves are used. The non-standard curves can be extracted from artistic works such as rangoli or character curves. In our work, we have created a model to determine whether a given curve is safe to use in cryptography for the Internet of Things environment. We considered the dataset from <a href=\"http://safecurves.cr.yp.to\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">safecurves.cr.yp.to</a> for two cases ECDLP security and ECC security. The parameters considered in the dataset are field, equation, base, rho, transfer, rigidity, discriminants, ladder, twist, completeness and indistinguishability. We also added additional parameters to make the curve legally and commercially implementable. In the first step, we applied the Find-S algorithm to find the most specific hypothesis and Candidate Elimination algorithm to find most general hypotheses. Next,we applied a decision tree algorithm to classify the curve as safe or unsafe. The model was developed using Python language.","created-at":"2020-01-27T11:15:33.337414+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-27T11:15:34.808000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Elliptic Curve Analysis for Cryptographic Applications in Internet of Things","level":"Beginner to Intermediate","video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-02-29T09:43:49.145622+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"6090"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"Session management is key to an app's user experience and security.

We hear and read more and more about \"shifting left\" the security practices, as we heard for code quality years ago, but we can observe that this ambition doesn't translate into real practices, and security reviews and fixes often come too late in the process.<strong>What does it really mean to shift left?</strong>Shifting left is not just a matter of running some tasks earlier in the process.Naive solutions consist in relying on tools to automate these tasks (security reviews, communication to developers) and run them earlier.These solutions miss the most important point: They don't empower the developers. <ul><li>Developers don't have a leading role in reducing this security debt. They just receive vulnerability reports, and must fix them.</li><li>Developers don't learn in the process, and repeat the same mistake again and again.</li><li>Most security review tools have a big false positive ratio.

And with Sugar Labs, Python comes into the center of it all, with all Open-Source educational projects based on the Python programming language.</p><p>You’ll be amazed at how educational projects like “Sugar” have changed the perception of how children actually learn. In this talk, we will be covering the main aspects of Sugar serving as a learning tool.

Now if you want analyze your spending habits or process financial accounts related your business then you need to take out the documents out of safe. This process is known as decryption. This step has a problem i.e.; the moment you take out the documents from the safe they become vulnerable to illegal entities. To avoid such situations, we need a mechanism to process documents without taking them out of the safe. It is possible through homomorphic encryption i.e., by performing computations on encrypted data and this talks addresses techniques to perform computations of encrypted data.The session begins with a discussion on homomorphic properties of cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, Elgamal, Paillier, Elliptic Curve and Gentry’s Cryptosystems with the demonstration. The session discusses the concept of recryption for secure computation. This session also discusses a case study on how machine learning techniques can be applied to encrypted data for secure computation and protecting the machine learning model. Finally, the utility of homomorphic encryption for blockchain will be discussed.*Implementation*The cryptographic algorithms have been implemented in Python. Also, the Python code has been written to verify the homomorphic properties of cryptographic algorithms. Homomorphic encryption techniques are computation intensive. To reduce the number of computations we used the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Karatsuba methods for performing arbitrary computations such as multiplication over large integers. Next to demonstrate the implementation of a secure machine learning model we combined cryptography package in python and PyBRAIN Artificial Intelligence package. A minimal blockchain was implemented in Python to perform secure computations in a blockchain environment.","created-at":"2020-01-24T08:34:55.769662+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-24T08:34:55.412000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Computation Techniques for Encrypted Data","level":"Beginner to Intermediate","video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-03-02T06:34:46.306429+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"6075"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"With the advent of Data Science and Machine Learning, Jupyter Notebooks have become a widespread platform to support exploration and experimentation required in the field.

The recent version released\non November 2019, Julia is becoming more and more popular everyday\nand is threatening to beat Python’s current position as a leading\nlanguage for machine learning. Though python has grown useful for\ndata science and machine learning, Julia is made from scratch for the\njob. Julia is one of just four languages that achieved petaflops\ncomputations, i.e a thousand million million floating point\noperations per second along side C, C++ and Fortan. Julia was made to\nbe usable for general programming, powerful for the most costly\nmathematical operations, simple to learn and yet to satisfy the most\nserious programmers. It’s core is implemented in Julia and C,\ntogether with C++ for the LLVM  dependency. Among it’s features is\nit’s superior parallelism over python, a syntax as simple as\npython’s, supports meta programming, can call Python, C and Fortan\nlibraries, includes automatic memory management, letting us enjoy one\nof python’s conveniences and it is incredibly fast, it can get very\nclose to or reach the speed of C at it’s best. \n</p>\n<p>\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nIt also has packages\nsupporting markup languages such as HTML, XML, JSON and BSON, and for\ndatabases and web use in general.
