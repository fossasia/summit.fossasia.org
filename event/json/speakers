So we do understand how important communities are. The question is, do we understand what is the essence of a community, or how to engage one and make sure it's moving forward?When we talk about measuring the success and health of a community, people like to throw around metrics without truly understanding if these numbers actually mean something for our community's growth. These 'vanity metrics' create an idea of pseudo-value and don't really say much about the state of our community. Just because it is something we can measure, it does not mean it is helpful. Do DevRel folks report back vanity metrics to their managers? Yes. Does this information say a lot about the direction the community is moving in? No. Do we need more sensible metrics? Absolutely.With my talk, 'The Anatomy of Communities', I aim to open up a new dimension to understanding the elements that make up a community and talk about applicable key metrics that actually make sense and can be employed to track the health of a community. The talk will take the audience through a human centric approach towards building positive, compassionate, and diverse spaces for developers and ensuring that these spaces don't experience stagnation.","created-at":"2020-01-21T19:05:05.458529+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-21T19:05:04.122000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"The Anatomy of Communities ","level":"Suitable for all audience ","video-url":null,"slides-url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b4qDl-f0Qzn_WRXTUXsmV4Lv78CMBcSeb9uJCneWI-w/edit?usp=sharing","last-modified-at":"2020-02-29T06:37:52.258510+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"Here is a rather short and rough version of this abstract that I did as an impromptu talk at React India 2019 community lounge.Video: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/10IipOe25xzzV0Gcj2qUyAzUbCLxN3OD5/view\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/10IipOe25xzzV0Gcj2qUyAzUbCLxN3OD5/view</a>","id":"6059"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/a74665c3/speakers?include=sessions&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"sponsorship-required":null,"github":"https://github.com/jollen","short-biography":"Jollen Chen is the creator and CEO of Flowchain, open source-based IoT blockchain solutions.

Some servers in production have very little usage or are used infrequently; therefore, availability may not be an issue. However, in an enterprise-class data center, many of the servers experience almost continuous and sometimes heavy usage, therefore, availability is extremely important. High Availability (HA) is a goal in such environments and is the ability of a server or a combination of servers to achieve as close to 100% usability as possible. In this paper, we will focus some of the open source solutions in HA space. We focus our attention on both RHEL and SLES environments. We will cover various HA solutions such as heartbeat, mon (on SLES and they also work with RHEL) and rgmanager and cman (that are available on RHEL environment).

I would also talk about the different module patterns and when to use them.</p><p>In short, this session would give a clear picture on how breaking down your codebase will help you take down a lot of problems</p>","id":"5741"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/a74665c3/speakers?include=sessions&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"sponsorship-required":null,"github":"https://github.com/reinauer","short-biography":"Stefan has been the fiddling around with open source firmware since the previous millennium and loves to push the bare iron to the limit.

I only wanted to convey the sentiment - 'Let's make web-accessible again’.  However, this is exactly how the text will appear to a dyslexic person reading this. It is but one of the many issues differently-abled people face every day on the web. And web in its very nature is supposed to be a place accessible to all. It is for everyone no matter what their hardware, software, language, location, internet quality or ability. Even the first website ever developed in 1991 was fully accessible. So why are we engineers making it inaccessible?</p><p>If you think it doesn’t really matter because the target audience is small, think again! Talking about numbers, currently, 15% of the world population have some form of disability. An inaccessible website is not only very unempathetic but also a barrier to potential consumers. Mike BrolyLegs Begum, the renowned esports Street Fighter player, is a perfect example of one of the stories about people overcoming a degenerative condition with the help of assistive technologies.</p><p>Moreover, websites need to maintain a specified level of accessibility to be legal. It’s not uncommon for giants to pay hefty fines for lawsuits filed against their websites being inaccessible. A report found about 2,258 website accessibility-related lawsuits were filed in 2018, up from just over 800 in 2017. It’s only when biggies like Domino’s are targeted,  people take things more seriously.</p><p>A lot of people tend to ignore accessibility when designing a website because it’s hard to notice. Also, it is not a part of the curriculum. Furthermore, there’s a lot of misconception about how making a website accessible hampers it’s design. It’s actually the opposite. Accessible websites are a better experience for all users, as has been proven by the roaring success of - <a href=\"https://www.parrapark.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.parrapark.com.au/</a>. This gap of knowledge needs to be filled and this is what I aim to do.</p><p>Through my talk, I want to touch on the following topics: - What exactly is accessibility? (Hint: It’s greater than being accessible to disabled)- What are the consequences of an inaccessible website?- Types of Disabilities- How to make your website accessible and WCAG compliant?- How to check how accessible your website is?</p><p>Accessibility is a need, a good habit, an empathetic decision, and a human right and as web developers, it’s our core responsibility to incorporate that!</p>","created-at":"2019-12-20T18:28:50.664346+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2019-12-20T18:28:49.010000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Let's Make The Web Accessible Again!","level":"All levels","video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-01-18T18:56:46.036547+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"5894"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"<p>Drag and drop is a quite widely used utility.

At the very early stage, web development comprised of a small number of technologies and uncomplicated processes. JavaScript became the dominant language in front-end application development. Along the timeline, several solutions emerged to abstract the complexity of application logic. These abstractions led to different generations in JavaScript application development. Each library and framework developed provided different levels of abstractions based on different sets of fundamental ideas. jQuery provided convenient APIs to manipulate DOM. Structured single-page applications were created with Backbone.js Ember.js, and Angular.js. To address the performance issues, React came up with virtual DOM. As a result of solving different important issues, eventually many generations of JavaScript applications were born. Svelte presents the next step in JavaScript application development. Svelte is an open-source UI compiler that takes all the heavy lifting from runtime to build stage. Svelte encapsulates the idea of generating a highly optimized codebase at the build stage and takes a step away from the virtual DOM mechanism.

Carpenter of IAB and Fred Baker of IETF wrote a \nco-statement on cryptographic technology and the internet.  This RFC \nwasn't a request for a technical standard, it was a statement on their \nconcerns about Governments trying to restrict or interfere with \ncryptography. They felt that there was a need to offer \"All Internet \nUsers an adequate degree of privacy\"\n\nSince that time successive governments around the world have sought to \nbuild back doors into encrypted apps and services to access more citizen\n and visitor data. As of July 2019, the AG of the United States William\n Barr stated: “Some argue that, to achieve at best a slight incremental \nimprovement in security, it is worth imposing a massive cost on society \nin the form of degraded safety,” i.e For security Americans should \naccept weakened encryption.  The head of the FBI also claimed that \nweakened encryption wouldn't break it.  \n\nIn Australia the metadata retention laws have been abused against \njournalists with 58 searches carried out by the AFP.  In 2015 ACT police\n carried out 115 metadata searches.  UK officials have a cavalier \nattitude to the EU SIS database which tracks undocumented migrants, \nmissing people, stolen cars, or suspected criminals. IETF Session 105 mentioned privacy and concerns with the mass collection\n of data. While the IAB and IESG were worried about US export controls \non cryptography there is an argument for RFC 1984 to be updated to \ninclude the unnecessary mass collection of data and to use it as a term \nfor IT professionals, privacy advocates and the public to rally behind. In this talk let's recount a brief history of governments around the \nworld wanting to weaken encryption as RFC 1984 warned us about.  \n\nWe live in a time where citizens put data into commercial, healthcare \nand Government systems to access services, some services are only \naccessible online. From CCTV to Facebook people have little \nunderstanding of why mass collection of data is dangerous. There is \nlittle scrutiny of who can access that data, from Scotland to the US. Open Surveillance is only a small part of the picture when profiling \ncitizens.  It still counts as personal data, when combined with metadata\n and the actual data that people put into social media and services like\n ancestor DNA test kits.  Businesses who use CCTV have to put up signs \nto warn the public they are recording.  So called anonymized data still \ncontains identifiers that can tie to individuals. \nLet's talk about Ovid and peacocks. Let's explore how to expand the RFC \nto cover recent developments in surveillance capitalism with governments\n accessing that data, but not securing it. We need to make it clear \nweakened encryption, the mass collection and careless retention of data \nisn't acceptable. We need to update and implement RFC 1984.","created-at":"2020-01-25T10:12:39.902607+00:00","state":"confirmed","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":"2020-03-21T16:20:00+00:00","subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-25T10:12:39.371000+00:00","starts-at":"2020-03-21T15:30:00+00:00","language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"RFC 1984: Or why you should start worrying about encryption backdoors and mass data collection  [Online]","level":"Understandable by everyone.","video-url":"https://youtu.be/2AgPQFLFMZU","slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-04-08T13:59:31.677637+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"Why we need to implement RFC 1984:\n\n\"The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering\n   Steering Group (IESG),[...] are concerned by the need for increased\n   protection of international commercial transactions on the Internet,\n   and by the need to offer all Internet users an adequate degree of\n   privacy.\n\" \nI'd like to start by briefly mentioning Ovid and the legend of Io.  Ovid\n was anti authoritarian during the time of Augustus as he'd been exiled \nby the Emperor.  He wrote The Metamorphoses; an epic poem about Greek \nmyths with the theme of transformation. The myth is often used as a \nmetaphor for surveillance.  With Io suffering restriction of liberty and\n being abused by authority.

Argus is a\n great name for a security firm in fact there are quite a few firms that\n use an eye in the logo. Pop culture like Neil Gamien's American gods on Amazon  have also \nreferenced this legend to show surveillance and how it can convey power \nto authority. In the end a modern interpretation of the myth could \nargue that Hermes sending Argus to sleep to kill him is a good metaphor \nfor opposing actors using exploits to subvert and disable surveillance \nto access information to Citizens data.   We focus more on Argus the \nagent of Surveillance rather than Io, who was violated, changed and then\n incarcerated with surveillance against her will. Argus Panoptes inspired the idea of the Panopticon. A  building design \nby English Philospher Jeremy Bentham as a prison that could be observed \nby a single guard.  Our Internet is in danger of being a virtual \npanopticon for future citizens.  The EFF already started thinking about \nthis with panopticlick so that you can test who's tracking you through \nyour browser. So who's watching us? Of course this explanation and the metaphor is from a Western \nPerspective.  Privacy doesn't mean the same thing to all countries and \ncultures.  Neither does the symbolism of the Peacock. There will be a brief explanation of  RFCs for those who don't know what\n they are. They are Requests for Comment and some of them become \nprotocols for services like Emails RFC 2822 - Internet Message Format, \nRFC 5321 - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.  RFC Protocols are a very good\n way of creating technical standards so that everyone on the internet \ncan communicate and access data. \n\nMany IT professionals consider RFCs are more like guidelines, see RFC \n<a href=\"http://Clueless.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Clueless.org</a>. Popular email services like <a href=\"http://Me.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Me.com</a>, <a href=\"http://Outlook.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Outlook.com</a> and even \n<a href=\"http://gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">gmail.com</a> have been listed on RFC ignorant, then it's successor RFC \nclueless .  Sadly the giants often ignore RFCs.   Which breaks the idea \nof interoperable standards and protocols and leaves us in danger of \nbeing at the  mercy of large hosting giants. There is a narrative that threads through the media since that time.  \nPrivacy is dead, you need to give up that freedom to stay safe.  \nPoliticians like the UK Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015 stated:\n\n.\"In our country, do we want to allow a means of communication between \npeople which even in extremis, with a signed warrant from the home \nsecretary personally, that we cannot read? “Up until now, governments \nhave said: ‘No, we must not'.\" \"\n\nMalcolm Turnbull the Australian Prime Minister in 2017 stated that \" the\n laws of Australia take precedence over the laws of mathematics.\"  \n\nWith organizations like Palantir providing information to ICE to target \nillegal immigrants in the US; The UK Home Office deliberately destroying\n data in the the Windrush scandal;  It's clear that human rights, \nspecifically the right to privacy is in danger. \n\nThat's before I even start on repressive regimes where that data can and\n will be used to oppress citizens of that regime.  Australia is not \nimmune from this desire for governments to spy and profile their own \ncitizens and to provide a hostile environment to immigrants and it's own\n citizens who may criticize that government. \nThe recent IETF Session 105 this month mentioned privacy and concerns \nwith the mass collection of data. While the IAB and IESG were worried \nabout US export controls on cryptography there is an argument for \nRFC1984 to be updated to include the unnecessary mass collection of data\n and to use it as a term for IT professionals, privacy advocates and the\n public to rally behind. I propose a brief history of governments around the world wanting to \nweaken encryption as RFC1984 warned us about:\n\n \" The IAB and IESG are therefore disturbed to note that various\n   governments have actual or proposed policies on access to\n   cryptographic technology that either: \n   (a) impose restrictions by implementing export controls; and/or\n\n   (b) restrict commercial and private users to weak and inadequate\n       mechanisms such as short cryptographic keys; and/or \n   (c) mandate that private decryption keys should be in the hands of\n       the government or of some other third party; and/or \n   (d) prohibit the use of cryptology entirely, or permit it only to\n       specially authorized organizations.\" RFC 1984 was explicitly named to reference an Orwellian Society that \nuses mass surveillance.  Let's expand that beyond encryption to the mass\n collection of data and ask how do we limit this?  How do we limit \naccess to this data?  How do we stop the nightmare?\n\nAddendum: As time goes on with the current political climate, I expect \nmore focus by the media and the IAB and the IETF on this subject.  So \nwhile the overall thrust of this presentation will be the same, I plan \nto keep it as fresh as possible.

Checking of individual PV panel in the array will be a major problem, especially in areas that are hardly affected by soiling. Soiling could affect all the panels in the solar array or could effect in strings, but in both cases the power will decrease drastically which effects the connected loads. Solar photo voltaic (PV) farm output power mainly depends on panel conditions such as voltage, current etc. Soiling leads to faults in the solar panels which further results in system maximum power output. In Large number of solar panels it is very difficult to detect the fault in an individual panel since it is usually done manually. To reduce manual efforts this project is proposed to detect the output of individual PV panel automatically and eventually evaluates the condition of each panel in the solar PV array. The proposed project measures the open circuit voltage the short circuit current and the delivered power for each PV panel in the array. It is also capable of controlling each panel to reduce the effects of soiling. The prototype system consists of wireless sensor network, which continuously monitors the solar PV panels in array and update to the operator to take action on particular panel for removing soling on panel. </p>","created-at":"2020-01-23T08:12:10.722773+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-23T08:11:53.714000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Low Cost Solar String Failure Detection and Monitor System ","level":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-02-29T08:26:03.294849+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"6070"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/a74665c3/speakers?include=sessions&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"sponsorship-required":null,"github":"https://github.com/ishammohamed","short-biography":"Working as a Senior Software Developer for a Microsoft Partner in KL since 2018.

Essentially this would allow React to perform multiple UI renders concurrently. The new features will allow web apps (and Native Apps once these features hit React Native) to be much more responsive and snappy than they are now with less effort and custom code from the developer to make this happen.</p><p><strong>What does it bring?</strong></p><p>It allows for a new way to minimize the impact of CPU bound and IO bound operations on the client. By enabling React to perform multiple renders concurrently, we can prioritize parts of the application to render as early as possible. We can construct code for components that depend on data that is fetched asynchronously that is easy to manage, debug and reason about.</p><p>Currently the easiest way to use concurrent mode is to use the Suspense API along with useTransition and useDeferredValue hooks.</p><p><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p><p>The React team has said they intend Suspense to become the de-facto way of accessing any data from a React app. It will enable developers to create better UX while not worrying about race conditions that usually comes with asynchronous operations.</p><p><strong>What will the talk cover?</strong></p><p>Concurrent mode is now available in the experimental build of React, and in this talk I will dig in and see how to use the shiny new API, complete with demos.

I joined the Technology team of Bank of America right after graduation and so far, I've been a part of the Data Management and Information Strategy team. From being part of the Machine Learning POC team to developing applications to manage the data, my work so far has been pretty satisfying. <strong>Our mentor, Guruswamy Revana helped me become the person I am. </strong>","twitter":"https://twitter.com/PrajnaVegesna","city":"","instagram":null,"photo-url":"https://api.eventyay.com/static/media/temp/images/59fb9926-65d2-47a4-85c2-31a948782745/c2ppcHRZMy/31748787-45d1-453f-b8c4-97b65283efd7.jpeg","deleted-at":null,"long-biography":null,"email":"vppragnya@gmail.com","mobile":"","is-email-overridden":false,"country":"India","facebook":null,"speaking-experience":"","organisation":"Bank of America","heard-from":"Guruswamy Revana, Professor at BVRIT Hyderabad College of Engineering ","small-image-url":"https://api.eventyay.com/static/media/users/4397/small/azRhemYrbj/15525ae0-d176-4f8d-8ee8-a42fad915c07.jpg","name":"Prajna  Vegesna","is-featured":false,"thumbnail-image-url":"https://api.eventyay.com/static/media/users/4397/thumbnail/ajB2VkFoY3/c94eb71a-ee17-48aa-9324-0baefa02ee1d.jpg","gender":"st496","icon-image-url":"https://api.eventyay.com/static/media/users/4397/icon/T1NhSzNnYz/7b27ecab-0515-4f2f-81bb-9e0b2ba12b77.jpg","website":"https://linkedin.com/in/prajna-vegesna-64778250/","complex-field-values":null,"position":"Senior Tech Associate","linkedin":null,"id":"4397","sessions":[{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"Just when the world has started recognizing the dire need of giving Mental Health more attention than we used to, technology has also started moving towards recognizing the miracles Machine Learning and Deep Learning is capable of by leveraging the new gold mine of this decade, Data. Through this talk, I would like to present my project on detecting, predicting and classifying mental health issues at an individual level and also understand what factor influences mental health for different individuals. My project aims to develop a predictive model based on machine learning approaches to figure out which factors (genetics, demographics, environmental) influence high vs low risk of being diagnosed by various mental health issues (anxiety, depression, panic attacks, dementia) <strong>The key objectives are:</strong>1.

The presentation will discuss the challenges faced by the community during its incredible growth over the past 10 years. LibreOffice was born as a desktop office suite for Windows, macOS and Linux, and is now available in the cloud as a Saas solution. So, the community is focused not only on development and related tasks as QA and UX, but also on other key activities such as end user documentation and marketing. In Addition, there is a specific focus on fundraising, as the project is not backed by a company but is completely independent. The historical overview will be based on software releases, adding facts and figures about the project. The objective is to provide a better understanding of the LibreOffice community to people who have followed the evolution from outside, through announcements and events.

You will store them in safe and lock it with a key. This process is known as encryption. Now if you want analyze your spending habits or process financial accounts related your business then you need to take out the documents out of safe. This process is known as decryption. This step has a problem i.e.; the moment you take out the documents from the safe they become vulnerable to illegal entities. To avoid such situations, we need a mechanism to process documents without taking them out of the safe. It is possible through homomorphic encryption i.e., by performing computations on encrypted data and this talks addresses techniques to perform computations of encrypted data.The session begins with a discussion on homomorphic properties of cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, Elgamal, Paillier, Elliptic Curve and Gentry’s Cryptosystems with the demonstration. The session discusses the concept of recryption for secure computation. This session also discusses a case study on how machine learning techniques can be applied to encrypted data for secure computation and protecting the machine learning model. Finally, the utility of homomorphic encryption for blockchain will be discussed.*Implementation*The cryptographic algorithms have been implemented in Python. Also, the Python code has been written to verify the homomorphic properties of cryptographic algorithms. Homomorphic encryption techniques are computation intensive. To reduce the number of computations we used the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Karatsuba methods for performing arbitrary computations such as multiplication over large integers. Next to demonstrate the implementation of a secure machine learning model we combined cryptography package in python and PyBRAIN Artificial Intelligence package. A minimal blockchain was implemented in Python to perform secure computations in a blockchain environment.","created-at":"2020-01-24T08:34:55.769662+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-24T08:34:55.412000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Computation Techniques for Encrypted Data","level":"Beginner to Intermediate","video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-03-02T06:34:46.306429+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"6075"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"Today machine learning is the buzzword.

The talk begins with an introduction to machine teaching and how it differs from Machine learning. Then talk continues to explain the advantage of bias in learning and its benefits to machine teaching to achieve better results. Then finally talk concludes with a case study where building machine teaching application will be demonstrated step by step. The current techniques using machine learning models focus more on training data to determine the state of the system or a model. However, this approach has a drawback that it takes months’ time to give the results for complex problems. Machine teaching is a new concept which focuses on optimizing the training data to achieve the results in a few days. The optimization of training data can be achieved by using human experience and integrating this human experience into the machine learning model. The machine teaching discipline has applications in security, education and AI System building. We applied machine teaching concepts to web application security and achieved improved performance. We divided the dataset into small datasets and applied machine learning algorithms. Then the results of these small models are used to train our model using the LSTM algorithm. The implementation has been done in Python.","created-at":"2020-01-27T04:37:21.016846+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-27T04:37:22.392000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Machine Teaching: The Future of Artificial Intelligence","level":"beginner to intermediate","video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-02-29T09:43:00.870605+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"6089"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"Elliptic curves widely used in cryptography especially in resource-constrained environments such as the Internet of Things. There are many curve standards used in Elliptic Curve Cryptography such as ANSI X9.62 (1999), IEEE P1363 (2000), SEC 2 (2000), NIST FIPS 186-2 (2000), ANSI X9.63 (2001), Brainpool (2005), NSA Suite B (2005), and ANSSI FRP256V1 (2011). All the standards try to address the elliptic-curve discrete-logarithm problem(ECDLP) but they fail in one or more aspects such as rigidity, transfer, rho or field discriminants. The implementation of the above standard produces incorrect results and leaks data with respect to some curves. The problem even worsens when non-standard curves are used. The non-standard curves can be extracted from artistic works such as rangoli or character curves. In our work, we have created a model to determine whether a given curve is safe to use in cryptography for the Internet of Things environment. We considered the dataset from <a href=\"http://safecurves.cr.yp.to\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">safecurves.cr.yp.to</a> for two cases ECDLP security and ECC security. The parameters considered in the dataset are field, equation, base, rho, transfer, rigidity, discriminants, ladder, twist, completeness and indistinguishability. We also added additional parameters to make the curve legally and commercially implementable. In the first step, we applied the Find-S algorithm to find the most specific hypothesis and Candidate Elimination algorithm to find most general hypotheses. Next,we applied a decision tree algorithm to classify the curve as safe or unsafe. The model was developed using Python language.","created-at":"2020-01-27T11:15:33.337414+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-27T11:15:34.808000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Elliptic Curve Analysis for Cryptographic Applications in Internet of Things","level":"Beginner to Intermediate","video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-02-29T09:43:49.145622+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"6090"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"Imagine you are passing through an unknown street at midnight and you find that some antisocial elements are following you.

We are also looking for fully automating an application which includes handling updates and recovery, scaling the application up or down. All this should be automatically done without human intervention. To achieve this goal operator comes in picture. An Operator is an application-specific controller that extends the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex stateful applications on behalf of a Kubernetes user. It builds upon the basic Kubernetes resource and controller concepts but includes domain or application-specific knowledge to automate common tasks. Writing, testing and packaging operator is an arduous job. CoreOs introduced a framework for writing, testing, and packaging operator called operator-SDK and made developer’s life easy. Operator-SDK includes testing package using which we can write e2e and unit tests. This workshop focuses on testing the operator using operator-SDK's test package. Writing your operator and basics of the operator will be covered in this workshop. The audience for this talk will be developer, tester or a person who pretty much works with operators on Kubernetes.

About 56% of the Reddit users are young adults between the age of 18-29. I ran a survey of animals that were mentioned in various Reddit posts last month. Surprisingly, Alpacas are one the least talked about animals. This made me really inquisitive and on further research, I found out that there no wild alpacas left and about 98% of their population has already been wiped out. So I decided to raise awareness about Alpacas among Reddit users by making an Alpaca Bot. This bot is just basically a loop that checks all the latest comments, sees if someone has said 'alpaca' and then comments a random fact on it. Reddit allows programs to interact with their website by allowing those programs to access certain data through PRAW, where you can use python to access all the latest comments from all subreddits.<strong></strong>","created-at":"2020-02-25T10:20:41.756867+00:00","state":"confirmed","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":"2020-03-21T11:00:00+00:00","subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-02-25T10:20:40.633000+00:00","starts-at":"2020-03-21T10:00:00+00:00","language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Building Bots to Raise Awareness on Endangered Animals on Social Media","level":"Novice","video-url":"https://youtu.be/faNQy3HBBm0","slides-url":"https://slides.com/sohamchatterjee/deck-98fc6a#/","last-modified-at":"2020-04-08T08:47:10.218867+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"You can find the repository here: <a href=\"https://github.com/soham96/AlpacaBot\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/soham96/AlpacaBot</a>","id":"6160"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/a74665c3/speakers?include=sessions&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"sponsorship-required":null,"github":null,"short-biography":"Kiruthika Ramanathan is a Senior Manager working for the Science Centre, where one of her tasks is to develop programmes to expose the younger generation to code.","twitter":null,"city":null,"instagram":null,"photo-url":"https://api.eventyay.com/static/media/temp/images/9f8ddc9f-ae64-471a-8f93-1f26e8767eb3/eERha0Fqbl/ec27beb8-6ae3-49aa-b74a-9c90563c95ef.jpeg","deleted-at":null,"long-biography":null,"email":"Kiruthika_RAMANATHAN@science.edu.sg","mobile":null,"is-email-overridden":false,"country":null,"facebook":null,"speaking-experience":"","organisation":"Science Centre Singapore","heard-from":null,"small-image-url":"https://api.eventyay.com/static/media/users/4738/small/M0JoL0w0Rk/08aa4b94-d95e-475e-901c-4dd0e35025e9.jpg","name":"Kiruthika Ramanathan","is-featured":false,"thumbnail-image-url":"https://api.eventyay.com/static/media/users/4738/thumbnail/WUZRbVMvcE/38494ea8-cab3-46a2-b219-23c28b8ef488.jpg","gender":"Female","icon-image-url":"https://api.eventyay.com/static/media/users/4738/icon/aGpwdEM2L2/0207a6c5-d564-4580-8952-7dcdb3c079b8.jpg","website":null,"complex-field-values":null,"position":"Senior Manager ","linkedin":null,"id":"4738","sessions":[{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"Welcome to the FOSSASIA Summit 2020!","created-at":"2020-03-05T10:57:00.458820+00:00","state":"confirmed","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":"2020-03-19T10:10:00+00:00","subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-03-05T10:57:00.259000+00:00","starts-at":"2020-03-19T10:00:00+00:00","language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"FOSSASIA Summit 2020 - Towards a Sustainable Society","level":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-03-14T17:12:33.133447+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"6193"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/a74665c3/speakers?include=sessions&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"sponsorship-required":null,"github":null,"short-biography":"Sales Engineer at Confluent Inc","twitter":"https://twitter.com/twfakecandy","city":null,"instagram":null,"photo-url":"https://api.eventyay.com/static/media/temp/images/c86c4edd-44f3-4181-b2c6-d7dcbdeb3faf/bUpIUUVpQT/cc584405-740d-46ce-bf47-1333e9be0cc9.png","deleted-at":null,"long-biography":null,"email":"teehan@confluent.io","mobile":null,"is-email-overridden":false,"country":"Singapore","facebook":null,"speaking-experience":"","organisation":"Confluent Inc","heard-from":null,"small-image-url":"https://api.eventyay.com/static/media/users/4410/small/dTN1MlRDZl/6b03f945-8b28-4a0d-8663-2c3f4f9778b4.jpg","name":"Mark Teehan","is-featured":false,"thumbnail-image-url":"https://api.eventyay.com/static/media/users/4410/thumbnail/QXpTQlpWNX/5e11e1e2-e536-4a7b-8f0b-bb7ac614b26e.jpg","gender":null,"icon-image-url":"https://api.eventyay.com/static/media/users/4410/icon/bW83QkNoUk/f7c49fb8-3315-4416-be03-85f3221d0ae4.jpg","website":null,"complex-field-values":null,"position":"Sales Engineer","linkedin":null,"id":"4410","sessions":[{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"Apache Kafka is emerging as the de-facto standard for building event driven applications.

The competition requires fast execution and innovation, while security threats require more control. The speed of execution and complexity of attacks increases exponentially, however the attacks almost systematically rely on missed security hygiene, highlighting an evident truth: security and other IT operators are stretched thin by manual processes and traditional approaches to <a href=\"http://security.As\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">security.As</a> DevOps approaches become mainstream, we can look at the evidence of what has enabled the success of the cloud tech giants: cloud-native architectures. Leveraging container orchestration, and end-to-end automation, cloud-native security enables security teams to reduce their manual tasks and focus on what matters most: reduce risk, developing added-value services, and collaborating with users and developers to raise awareness and build secure tools, finding vulnerabilities and suspicious activities and improving the incident response. In this presentation, we will review the improved security outcomes experienced by the largest organisations when transiting to a cloud-native architecture, as well as emerging practices enabling the teams to remain efficient and collaborate better.","created-at":"2019-12-05T08:33:40.430545+00:00","state":"confirmed","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":"2020-03-20T10:30:00+00:00","subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2019-12-05T08:33:25.382000+00:00","starts-at":"2020-03-20T10:00:00+00:00","language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"How cloud-native applications are helping organisations stay ahead of cybersecurity threats [Online]","level":"Beginner ","video-url":"https://youtu.be/XhaVisTZG4c","slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-03-19T14:59:35.969889+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"5705"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/a74665c3/speakers?include=sessions&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"sponsorship-required":null,"github":"https://github.com/akasurde","short-biography":"I am a core team member of the Ansible Project.

Book reading is neglected from daily routine which is essential for day to day learning, stress relief, better sleep and many other benefits.</li></ul><strong>Solution</strong>:- Bibly is an IOT based solution to let people share their already read books with others in the vicinity. Bibly has IOT racks which are to be installed at a particular location from where users can either borrow or share their books. The book identification is done through the <strong>barcode scanner </strong>and details to be fetched using Google books API. <strong>Keycloak</strong> is used for user identification, after successful authentication, user can access the shelf of the rack and can either pick or put a book in the shelf of the rack. Process flow of borrowing a book:-<ol><li>Visit the designated location where the rack is placed.</li><li>Scan the rack code from your phone camera, to see the available inventory.</li><li>Select the book you want to borrow in your phone</li><li>The flap of the shelf will get open</li><li>Take the book and enjoy reading</li></ol>Similar process for sharing the book. <strong>Hardware specifications:-</strong><ul><li>Level Shifter</li><li>Motor and solenoid driver with 12V power</li><li>IOT chipset(ESP8266) with 5V power - A low cost wifi microchip with full TCP/IP stack and micro controller capability.</li><li>Magnet to lock the flap</li><li>IR sensors to control the movement of motor</li></ul><strong>Audience</strong>:- Software professionals working on API, \ninterested in learning about IOT chipset, startup enthusiast (if get a \nchance will touch a little about business side too) <strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Take away</strong>:- Kick start any small IOT product using the hardware and software specifications discussed and learn how to expose Rails API.

The road accidents are major source of deaths, property damage and casualties throughout the globe every year. According to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2016 report states that there 464,674 collisions which caused 148,707 deaths in India. Deep learning has great potential in learning patterns and in dealing with real life data related to road traffic accidents. To address this significant issue we took a stab at evaluating the severity of road traffic accidents using deep learning. Through this undertaking, we additionally attempted to visualize a legitimate perception to evaluate the underlying root cause of the road traffic accidents. To implement this project, we gathered dataset from road transport authority of UK who is reponsible for making the data publicly available and maintaining the integrity of open sourced data for research and examination purposes. Later, we observed,there were about more than 40 factors on which the analysis was done and we tried predicting the severity of the road traffic accident based on various factors provided in the dataset using various deep learning architectures such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with CUDA deep neural network. The input dataset were highly Imbalanced due to this, the deep learning model was giving biases with accuracy of the model. To solve this problem, we tried sampling the data before feeding it to training model. The best performing model was CuDNNGRU followed by CuDNNLSTM which gave a test accuracy of about 83% and 79% respectively.</p>","created-at":"2019-12-20T15:07:09.854196+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2019-12-20T15:07:04.687000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":true,"title":"Estimating the severity of  road  traffic accidents using deep learning","level":"","video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-01-19T08:58:40.070286+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"This project is made by me to help the mankind in dealing with road traffic accidents as it causes the great amount of casualties.

The PDPC called on the public to provide feedback, so as to improve upon the current proposed framework.Answering the call for feedback, DataKind SG in partnership with Effective Altruism SG have prepared a detailed paragraph-by-paragraph response to the model framework. <a href=\"https://npwg-ai-sg.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://npwg-ai-sg.github.io/</a></p>","created-at":"2019-12-20T15:31:41.640227+00:00","state":"confirmed","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":"2020-03-21T12:30:00+00:00","subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2019-12-20T15:31:32.162000+00:00","starts-at":"2020-03-21T12:00:00+00:00","language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Using AI Responsibly [Online]","level":null,"video-url":"https://youtu.be/Qdy09_19zDw","slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-03-20T16:16:33.673598+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"5871"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/a74665c3/speakers?include=sessions&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"sponsorship-required":null,"github":null,"short-biography":"<p>I am an network engineer in Viettel Network company.

The developers need to support the product for its entire lifetime. The quality of product support is critical to the success of the product. Good product support makes users happy who will in turn become the best advocates of your product and bring more users. Bad product support will damage your company's image and waste marketing efforts that bring in users who are later disappointed by how the product is supported. For enterprise softwares, product support may even have legal implications with the requirements of SLAs. Traditionally companies that offer enterprise softwares hire a large group of enterprise sales people to install/configure and answer customer queries. This is not always scalable, especially when you are a small company or when your product has way too many users. WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging platforms, and is supporting billions of its users to keep in touch with their most closed ones by offering a simple interface and a secure end-to-end encrypted messaging channel. Since the close beta launch of the WhatsApp Business API 2018, we have seen great interests from innumerable businesses. Even with a relatively small list of closed beta partners, the topic of how to properly scale product support is always at the heart of the team. Unlike traditional enterprise softwares, We turn the other way, to the open source world, on how to scale product support. The open source software world is never short of popular product. Millions of developers are running their production system on Linux systems and building storefronts with React every day. Developers trust the system because they can see every line of code that builds up the product, they can fork their own clone to make customised changes and submit pull requests so the product can be improved. Developers can search through Github issues when they are stuck and the community powers itself. From a product perspective, this is a wonderful way to scale product support: by giving users tools that they can trust and offering users a platform where they can openly discuss issues and collaborate on solutions.

We will also share our insights and learnings from this exercise which would help companies control cost on public cloud.","created-at":"2019-12-20T19:32:07.057751+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2019-12-20T19:32:06.271000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Journey of Cloud Cost Optimization at Gojek","level":"Intermediate","video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-01-17T13:43:13.344021+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"5897"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/a74665c3/speakers?include=sessions&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"sponsorship-required":null,"github":"https://github.com/fasho","short-biography":"I am a Support Engineer working with Red Hat.

The recent version released\non November 2019, Julia is becoming more and more popular everyday\nand is threatening to beat Python’s current position as a leading\nlanguage for machine learning. Though python has grown useful for\ndata science and machine learning, Julia is made from scratch for the\njob. Julia is one of just four languages that achieved petaflops\ncomputations, i.e a thousand million million floating point\noperations per second along side C, C++ and Fortan. Julia was made to\nbe usable for general programming, powerful for the most costly\nmathematical operations, simple to learn and yet to satisfy the most\nserious programmers. It’s core is implemented in Julia and C,\ntogether with C++ for the LLVM  dependency. Among it’s features is\nit’s superior parallelism over python, a syntax as simple as\npython’s, supports meta programming, can call Python, C and Fortan\nlibraries, includes automatic memory management, letting us enjoy one\nof python’s conveniences and it is incredibly fast, it can get very\nclose to or reach the speed of C at it’s best. \n</p>\n<p>\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nIt also has packages\nsupporting markup languages such as HTML, XML, JSON and BSON, and for\ndatabases and web use in general. Few featured Julia packages are\n<em><strong>Flux</strong></em>, official Deep Learning Library, <em><strong>IJulia</strong></em>, the Julia kernel for\nJupyter, <em><strong>Gadfly</strong></em>, statistical graphics for Julia, <em><strong>TensorFlow</strong></em>, a Julia\nwrapper for TensorFlow, <em><strong>TextAnalysis</strong></em>, Julia package for text analysis\nand <em><strong>JuliaDB</strong></em>, parellel analytical database in pure Julia. Julia has\nalso attracted some high-profile users, investment manager BlackRock,\nBritish insurer Aviva, Federal Bank of New York, who noted that the\nlanguage helped them make models about 10 times faster.</p>\n<p>\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\nFlux, is Julia’s Machine\nLearning package. It comes “batteries included” with many useful\ntools but also lets you use the full power of the Julia language\nwhere you need it. A few notable features of Flux is <em><strong>gradient</strong></em>\nfunction used for finding the gradient of a function with respect to\neach argument, <em><strong>params</strong></em> helps you work with a collection of parameters,\n<em><strong>rnn</strong> </em>explicitly manage states, <em><strong>norm</strong></em> is a regulariser, <em><strong>Flux.train</strong></em> is used\nfor training a mode, Flux also provides the<em> <strong>onehot</strong></em> function to encode\nvariables and the inverse, <em><strong>onecold</strong></em> function. Flux also includes\npredefined Layers, Optimisers, Decays for ready use.</p>","created-at":"2020-01-29T16:44:56.632502+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-29T16:44:54.837000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Is Julia the Next Python?","level":"","video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-02-29T08:28:33.448091+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"6097"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/a74665c3/speakers?include=sessions&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"sponsorship-required":null,"github":"https://github.com/rish-16","short-biography":"Rishabh is a recent graduate from National Junior College, currently at the Bioinformatics Institute, A*STAR, where he is using Deep Learning and statistical analysis to help the COVID-19 efforts in Singapore.

Geospatial data is taking off, as companies realize that just about everyone needs the benefits of geospatially aware applications. As a result there are no shortages of unique but demanding use cases of how enterprises are leveraging large-scale and fast geospatial big data processing. The data must be processed in large quantities - and quickly - to reveal hidden spatiotemporal insights vital to businesses and their end users.  In the rush to tap into geospatial data, many enterprises will find that representing, indexing and querying geospatially-enriched data is more complex than they anticipated - and might bring about tradeoffs between accuracy, latency, and throughput.</p><p>This presentation will explore how we added location data to a scalable real-time anomaly detection application, built around Apache Kafka, and Cassandra. Kafka and Cassandra are designed for time-series data, however, it’s not so obvious how they can process geospatial data. In order to find location-specific anomalies, we need a way to represent locations, index locations, and query locations. We explore alternative geospatial representations including: Latitude/Longitude points, Bounding Boxes, Geohashes, and go vertical with 3D representations, including 3D Geohashes.

These are two opposing forces, with no solution fit for Mysterium Network readily available in the market.</p>The architecture of our payments system is a fusion of research and experimentation with existing Layer 2 solutions. But none of these fit our particular use case. <p><strong>Here were the main requirements of our proposed system:</strong></p><ol><li>High throughput – the network’s ability to handle frequent and small payments (eventually thousands per second)</li><li>Support for our native utility token, MYST</li><li>Anonymity while also being secure, such as through the use of identity registration and reputation system</li><li>Great user experience, removing as much complexity as possible for the end-user. </li></ol><p>We also had to consider that <em>consumers</em> won’t pay a large amount up-front and the service <em>providers </em>(nodes) are unlikely to offer their services without prepayment.</p>Our proposed solution fuses together the technologies and methodologies used by other payment solutions, such as State Channels.

As a continuation to this, I have done a project on ‘The Smart\nControlling of Microwave oven’. Microwave oven has become an indispensable\nappliance in the 21st century.The\nincreasing urbanisation in developing countries and\naccessibility to power has also led to an increase in the usage of microwave ovens at the household level\nworldwide.Today, microwave\novens are\nmainly used for cooking as well as for reheating of food. Compact design and easy portability of a microwave\noven is a factor anticipated to increase the demand and drives the growth of\nthe global microwave oven market. The proposed microwave oven has OVEN\nTOAST GRILLER and CONVECTION mode operation. This can be used for pre-heating\nthe food at a lower cost and it can be controlled with a mobile app. It can be\noperated from any place using WiFi or Bluetooth. Moreover\nthe oven can be programmed to operate at a certain temperature and for a\ncertain time according to the product to be heated, with a single tap on the\npicture of the product via the app. This increases the ease for heating a\ncertain food item because most of the people are ignorant of the right heat and\ntime required to heat a certain food item, such as a cake. This can also lead\nto increase in the use of ovens and will ultimately lead to a smarter country.\nNot only this, the oven will be also able to defrost an item and heat it with\njust a tap on the phone in the required time. </p>\n\n<p>In the prototype\nmodel, testing is done with a preheating temperature  upto a range of 30 degree. Using this smart oven\nis a hassle free process and time saving. After the food is cooked we receive\nalert and it will be turned off automatically.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Future scope:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>This microwave oven is used for\npre-heating and cooking the food with low cost. It can be further enhanced to be\nused as a smart oven to Scan\nbarcode on packaged food and automatically download the proper cooking\ninstructions to follow to prepare the food. Even a voice control systems\nsuch as Alexa or Google Assistant can be installed. It can track the\nmost commonly cooked foods to suggest customized quick settings and provide\nphotos of each step, and in some cases, even play short videos of recipe steps.\nMoisture\nsensors monitor food throughout the cooking process to prevent food from drying\nout and overcooking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This project emphasis the\npreheating and cooking of food using a smart microwave oven controlled by smartphone that is constructed at very low cost.</p>\n\n<p> </p>","created-at":"2019-12-20T13:28:16.708617+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2019-12-20T13:28:15.488000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":true,"title":"Smart Electronic Management System ","level":"Intermediate","video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-01-19T09:00:07.807584+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"<a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/vqT8bLtBqRRtM5YQ9\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://photos.app.goo.gl/vqT8bLtBqRRtM5YQ9</a>","id":"5859"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/a74665c3/speakers?include=sessions&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"sponsorship-required":null,"github":"https://github.com/mohitsuman","short-biography":"Mohit Suman is based out of India.

It would be more responsible for enterprises today to understand what, why and how to build from blockchain technology’s inherent strengths. The best way to work through is to – ‘Analyse and estimate well’ and ‘try building working systems and learn from the difficulties’. So the session aims to throw some light on the key principles, minimum conditions and best practices for successful Blockchain implementation. We will learn both from the success stories and failures.

If you run Vulture \non both your library and test suite you can find untested code. Due to \nPython's dynamic nature, static code analyzers like Vulture are likely \nto miss some dead code.

If you are lacking data related to your research domain in order to train a model and if your research is not in the domain of artificial intelligence, <strong>DAugmentor </strong>is for you to significantly increase the diversity of <strong>data</strong> available and to do rich augmentations that are required to enlarge your dataset for training models.","created-at":"2020-02-04T18:12:23.521463+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-02-04T18:12:21.563000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":true,"title":"DAugmentor - AI which augments data for you","level":"I am an experienced researcher in this domain and I have delivered a couple of tech talks in this domain as well.","video-url":null,"slides-url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YtDKyQOy4bKm7OiSqg-KY1w4MlCW1zIbEhOwHiSr5P4/edit?usp=sharing","last-modified-at":"2020-03-04T15:04:23.612181+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"I have to do alterations and add more content to the slides I am planning to do an interesting demo so there will be less slides.","id":"6118"}],"links":{"self":"/v1/events/a74665c3/speakers?include=sessions&page%5Bsize%5D=0"}},{"sponsorship-required":null,"github":"https://github.com/mjzone","short-biography":"<p>He is a Tech Lead at 99X Technology.

Many enterprises still rely upon them to do the bulk of their data-driven work and the modern mainframe is very good at what it does. But what if you’re looking to modernize your platform and bring in the DevOps methodologies, tooling, and practice into your organization? Is there a place for the mainframe?</p><p>Today, there is an entire product line of mainframes that exclusively run Linux (RHEL, SLES, or Ubuntu) rather than the data-focused, batch-processing operating systems they are best known for. For the security-conscious, encryption technology built into the processor and on additional PCIe cryptography cards is accessible in Linux, allowing for end-to-end encryption of data at rest and in flight that doesn’t burn all of your regular processing resources. Enterprise-grade hardware that also has built-in redundancy reduces the need for management you would have for a fleet of x86 servers, and modern mainframes even fit into a 19” rack space in the datacenter. With Linux in the mix, you get access to the vast ecosystem of open source software that’s already been ported to the mainframe architecture (s390x), with more being ported every month.</p>If your organization is still using an operating system like z/OS there’s also the Open Mainframe Project which has a series of open source projects targeted specifically at the mainframe and improving usability. Zowe, for instance, helps create a consolidated API for accessing resources and workload on your system and Feilong is a z/VM connector that allows you to manage your virtual machines with familiar open source tooling like OpenStack.

Open source software can be freely used according to the terms of its license (see the Open Source Definition and open source licenses at <a href=\"http://www.opensource.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.opensource.org</a>). Traditional enterprise software vendors often provide pre-purchase support for a trial of the software. While some FOSS projects have commercial sources of training and support, most users of FOSS must seek support from online forums and documentation or, in some cases, from commercially published books. It’s still uncommon for industry analysts to include open source software in their product evaluation frameworks. For organizations without prior experience with open source software, it has, until now, been necessary to rely solely on internal evaluations and “word of mouth” recommendations.  Even finding suitable candidate software can be daunting, and the process can prevent managers from trying to do so.This talk describes the OSSpal project, which is aimed at helping companies, government agencies, and other organizations find high quality free and open source software (FOSS) that meets their needs. OSSpal is a successor to the Business Readiness Rating (BRR), combining quantitative and qualitative evaluation measures for software in various categories. Instead of a purely numeric calculated score OSSpal adds curation of high-quality FOSS projects and individual user reviews of these criteria, OSSpal has an operational, publicly available website where users may search by project name or category, and enter ratings and reviews for projects.","created-at":"2019-12-18T16:36:54.496060+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2019-12-18T16:36:54.343000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"OSSpal: Finding and Evaluating Open Source Software","level":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-01-18T21:32:13.673762+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"5783"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"Not so long ago, those who favored and used open source software were a small minority of the computing community, with almost all use of free and open source software found in academia and the research community.  Corporations were reluctant to use open source, largely out of fears related to intellectual property and licensing. The dominant vendors of proprietary software were very successful in raising fears about open source software. As a result, open source solutions were rarely included in product evaluations or adopted for use in business-critical situations.Today, open source software is ubiquitous. More than a third of the world's servers run on Linux, RedHat's annual revenue exceeds $1B, and the vast majority of companies report that they are using open source software in their organization.  Even the largest proprietary software companies offer some open source software, and support various foundations involved in the creation of open source software.  Furthermore, large open source projects such as OpenStack and Hadoop are finding not only commercial adoption of their software, but also the creation of multiple vendors who offer professional services related to the use of the software.  This level of adoption was barely conceivable a decade ago, even to those people who have long been involved in the open source community.While open source software now seems firmly entrenched in the mainstream, the future of open source remains unclear in some areas. Apple's products, while using significant amounts of open source software, are completely proprietary, as are the vast majority of apps written for mobile platforms and other devices. The software embedded in automobiles, wearables, and medical devices is almost entirely proprietary, as is almost all software hosted in the cloud.  As a result, the future of open source software is not at all certain, and it will take a continuing effort to make companies, governments, and non-profit organizations aware of the value provided by open source software.This talk reviews the history of open source software, going back more than 30 years, but focusing on the present and on likely future trends.  The author hopes that this session can generate a lively discussion on the topic.","created-at":"2019-12-18T16:37:42.810515+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2019-12-18T16:37:42.697000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"The Mainstreaming of Open Source: a long-range perspective","level":null,"video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-03-01T08:43:48.611272+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"","id":"5784"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"In the 21st Century, the use of free and open source software (FOSS) has become mainstream, outgrowing its origins as the specialized interest of a small tech community.

Companies, governments, and other organizations have similarly adopted FOSS and have established policies and procedures for its use and distribution. At the same time, there remain significant barriers to FOSS adoption and vast numbers of proprietary applications.

Linearity and Conformity. Linearity is defined as the progression of education from one stage to another whereas conformity is how we standardize every process involved with education. Students in schools are not able to express their creativity, grow their cognitive skills and their logic building skills because of stringent rules, arcane examination system and the endless process of rote-learning. We like to be different, we like to be the change. Reinventing how we look at education in 2020 is the aim of Sugar Labs.</p><strong>How Sugar Labs help?</strong><p>Sugar Labs has been revolutionizing the approach to code teaching methods and how we educate children all over the world. And with Sugar Labs, Python comes into the center of it all, with all Open-Source educational projects based on the Python programming language.</p><p>You’ll be amazed at how educational projects like “Sugar” have changed the perception of how children actually learn. In this talk, we will be covering the main aspects of Sugar serving as a learning tool. We’ll take a quick tour of how the power of Python is being harnessed in the Sugar ecosystem to create hundreds of learning applications called activities that introduce children to programming, computational thinking and problem-solving with a special focus on learning by doing approach.</p><strong>Free/Libre Software</strong><p>Sugar is licensed under the General Public License. Sugar is written in Python and comes with all of the tools necessary to modify Sugar applications and itself. Python was chosen because of its transparency and clarity. It is a very approachable language for inexperienced programmers.</p><p>With just one keystroke or mouse click, the Sugar “View Source” feature allows the users to look at any program they are running. A second mouse click results in a copy of the application being saved to the Sugar Application (Activities) directory, where it immediately available for modification. We use a “copy on write” scheme in order to reduce the risk of breaking critical tools. If there is no penalty for breaking code, There is a better risk-reward for exploring and modifying the code.</p><strong>Activities</strong><p>Sugar comes with a lot of fun activities (Application) examples;</p><ul><li><p>Pippy allows the student to examine, execute and modify simple Python programs. A student can also write basic statements to play sounds, calculate expressions, or make simple text-based interactive games. Pippy allows you to create new Sugar activity and also create a library</p></li><li><p>Turtle Blocks is an activity with a Logo-inspired graphical “turtle” that draws colorful art based on the snap-together visual programming elements. Its “low floor” provides an easy entry point for beginners. Turtle Blocks allow learners to export projects into python code and edit them more in Pippy activity.</p></li><li><p>And many more.

In order for people to understand how to shape the Web – or even how to keep themselves safe online, or make a living with the Internet – there is a growing need to make sure everyone has the skills they need for healthy Internet citizenship. It needs to be realized that people who grew up with access to the Internet don’t automatically develop strong web literacy skills. We should resist the deepening of divides between the few who know how the technology works, and a majority who do not. We need everyone to recognize that Web literacy is more than coding.Web literacy is more than coding. Governments, educators and parents need to be champions for Web literacy and foster\ncreative opportunities for young people to develop these skills.

How do you adjust your recipe when your validation error matches your training error, but then your testing set error is high? This session will provide you with an answer to all of these questions and more. In this session, I’ll discuss the optimal way to apply deep learning techniques, starting with rules of thumb that can be used to adjust your techniques for training. I’ll then provide a decision process that can be used when deciding whether to should train a deep learning model from scratch or apply transfer learning. We will discuss the importance of taking the time to ensure that data used to train a model is representative of the images your network will see when deployed in a real-world application. If your input data does not represent examples of data points your model will see after being trained, you're essentially falling into the garbage in, garbage out trap. Instead, keep in mind that when performing experiments it's not possible for a deep learning model to perform well on data points it was never trained to recognize in the first place. This talk shall cover more small tips and tricks to tweak a convolutional neural network and improve its accuracy. By the end of this talk, you will have a strong understanding of rules of thumb that expert deep learning practitioners use when training their own networks.","created-at":"2020-01-16T10:50:12.795926+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-16T10:50:10.942000+00:00","starts-at":"2020-03-21T10:30:00+00:00","language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"The Optimal Pathway to Apply Deep Learning ","level":"3","video-url":null,"slides-url":null,"last-modified-at":"2020-03-02T21:13:30.540439+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"With the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the art of deep learning has risen as well.

But if a certain set of rules is kept in mind, it can save a person from wasting hours on training a network and obtaining a low accuracy or some other unexpected result. Attending this talk will help people understand some rules of thumb which if applied to deep learning will serve them hours of hassle. Using these techniques will be helpful for training any kind of deep learning model. By the end of this talk, the listeners will have a strong understanding of rules of thumb that expert deep learning practitioners use when training their own networks.","id":"6006"},{"long-abstract":null,"deleted-at":null,"average-rating":null,"short-abstract":"<p>Flutter is a UI Toolkit provided by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It gives developers an easy way to build and deploy visually attractive, fast mobile apps on both Android and iOS platforms. Flutter enables a smooth and easy cross-platform mobile app development. In order to use an app made suing Flutter, a user still needs to interact with the device and the most common type of interaction is gestures.  Gestures are primarily a way for a user to interact with a mobile (or any touch-based device) application. Flutter provides excellent support for all types of gestures through its exclusive widget, GestureDetector. GestureDetector is a non-visual widget primarily used for detecting the user’s gesture. This talk will focus on the callbacks provided by the extremely versatile GestureDetector widget and how the GestureDetector actually works. We will go deep into the internal working of the widget to understand what actually happens in the backend and see all the components involved. </p>","created-at":"2020-01-19T07:40:28.716993+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2020-01-19T07:40:24.796000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"A Deep Dive into Flutter Gestures","level":"3/5","video-url":null,"slides-url":"https://slides.com/yashkhare/deck","last-modified-at":"2020-02-29T09:51:03.650585+00:00","complex-field-values":null,"comments":"Flutter provides a lot mind-blowing widgets out of the box which are pre-built to handle touch events such as in InkWell and InkResponse.

In this session \nwe will see why and how to virtualize a container. </p>","created-at":"2019-09-24T13:49:46.570522+00:00","state":"rejected","is-mail-sent":false,"audio-url":null,"signup-url":null,"ends-at":null,"subtitle":null,"submitted-at":"2019-09-24T13:49:46.247000+00:00","starts-at":null,"language":null,"is-locked":false,"title":"Virtualizing the Containers.
