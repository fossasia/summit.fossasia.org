Having been awarded several other competitive research fellowships and design competitions, including the Penny White Prize at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design, the Rajawali Research Grant from Harvard University's Kennedy School Indonesia Program, and Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute Public Art Competition, Christina\u2019s work aims to merge design and research practices through multi-media publication, exhibitions, and spacial installations. Christina holds a Bachelors of Architecture from the University of Tennessee and two graduate degrees from Harvard University\u2019s Graduate School of Design: a Masters of Architecture and Urban Design and a Masters of Landscape Architecture. As a research and design contributor, her work has been featured in several publications, including WIRED: Japan and Harvard GSD Platform [6,7, &amp;8]. She has also taught architecture and urban design studios at the University of Tennessee College of Architecture + Design and Harvard University's Graduate School of Design Career Discovery Program. </span></p>", "sessions": [{"id": 2894, "title": "PetaBencana.id: Software as Infrastructure"}], "facebook": "", "sponsorship_required": "", "icon": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2248/icon/RTRGeGdzcV/a3f4bc20-51c4-47f4-bb63-1b7eed4a4b9b.jpg", "github": "https://github.com/urbanriskmap", "name": "Christina Geros", "speaking_experience": "", "country": "Indonesia", "gender": "Female", "small": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2248/small/dWJ3MmRSSS/f7373c36-5e7b-4261-bc58-23e010679f54.jpg", "position": "Architect"}, {"photo": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2250/photo/OXVYOE55a1/fa17b270-9214-4b6d-b2bb-7f996868f8a7.png", "twitter": "https://twitter.com/mbj36", "linkedin": "https://in.linkedin.com/in/mbj36", "featured": false, "id": 2250, "city": "Katra", "long_biography": "<p></p>", "organisation": "Mifos Initiative", "heard_from": "Website", "thumbnail": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2250/thumbnail/eDVCaCtTcl/1d1d874d-a0d1-4691-8f31-b7826c17970d.jpg", "website": "", "short_biography": "<p><span style=\"\">Google summer of Code student under mifos initiative and Google Code in Mentor, Open Source Enthusiast </span></p>", "sessions": [{"id": 2896, "title": "Progressive web app - Browser Based offline support"}], "facebook": "", "sponsorship_required": "", "icon": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2250/icon/YjNqa0UwTV/92bfeff1-e0d3-4256-9fc7-3316d4545d34.jpg", "github": "https://github.com/mbj36", "name": "Mohit Kumar Bajoria", "speaking_experience": "", "country": "India", "gender": "Male", "small": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2250/small/UXc4RnM5UD/aa927e63-6e39-4169-b0e6-9e1f13b35707.jpg", "position": ""}, {"photo": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2327/photo/MFFQbVZyOW/9e23a24d-defa-4993-a1a5-e972b335e025.png", "twitter": "", "linkedin": "", "featured": false, "id": 2327, "city": "Berlin", "long_biography": "", "organisation": "", "heard_from": "Website", "thumbnail": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eventyay.com/events/6/speakers/2327/thumbnail/ZUhGZTBuRG/dfe02720-6cc6-49f6-9300-390056814418.jpg", "website": "", "short_biography": "<p><span style=\"\">Alessandro joins open-source projects combining biology skills with hardware-software programming.
